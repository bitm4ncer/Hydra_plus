- Added `coverArtCacheTotalSize` tracking
- Implemented `evictOldestCacheEntry()` - LRU eviction when cache is full
- Implemented `addToCoverArtCache(imageUrl, buffer)` - smart cache insertion with size checks
- Modified `downloadCoverArt()` to use new cache management

**Benefits:**
- **Before:** Cache could grow to GB sizes during album downloads
- **After:** Maximum 50MB cache, oldest entries auto-evicted
- Prevents memory exhaustion on large album batches

---

#### 2. ✅ Metadata Cache with TTL and Size Limits
**File:** `Hydra+_Plugin/__init__.py`

**Changes:**

- Modified `_cleanup_old_data()` to expire cache entries
- Implemented LRU eviction when cache exceeds size limit
- Updated cache storage to include timestamps: `{'data': metadata, 'timestamp': time}`
- Updated cache reads to check TTL before use

**Benefits:**
- **Before:** Cache grew indefinitely, no expiration
- **After:** 10-minute TTL, max 1000 entries, automatic cleanup
- Prevents memory leaks on long-running instances

---

#### 3. ✅ Adaptive Polling (Active/Idle/Sleep Modes)
**File:** `Hydra+_Plugin/__init__.py`

**Changes:**
- Added `last_activity_time`, `current_poll_interval`, `poll_mode` tracking

  - **Active mode:** 2s interval (when searches/downloads active)
  - **Idle mode:** 10s interval (no activity for 30s-5min)
  - **Sleep mode:** 30s interval (no activity for 5+ minutes)
- Update activity time on: new searches, active searches, active downloads

**Benefits:**
- **Before:** Constant 2-second polling (30 polls/min) even when idle
- **After:** Adapts to activity level (2s → 10s → 30s intervals)
- Reduces CPU usage by 80% during idle periods
- Instant response when active, efficient when idle

---

#### 4. ✅ Enhanced Health Check Endpoint

  - Memory usage (heap, peak, cache sizes)
  - Request/error counts
  - Cache hit rate
  - Queue depths
  - Uptime
- Added `updateHealthMetrics()` function
- Track metrics throughout server operations

**Benefits:**
- **Before:** Basic status check only

- **After:** Lightweight polling (2 checks/second)
- Less DOM observation overhead
- Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks

---

#### 13. ✅ Comprehensive Extension Cleanup
**File:** `Hydra+_Extension/content.js`

**Changes:**
